# Log Book

## Days 1 & 2 

```java
class myClass {
    
  String s = String.format("Format string content: %.2f %d %s ", myFloat, myInt, myString);
  // then in main or method you can run print as:
  // System.out.println(s);
}
```

Lesson about difference in behavior of & / && and | / || was interesting for me someone coming from Python / Ruby.
